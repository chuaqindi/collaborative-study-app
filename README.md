# ðŸ‘‹ Study Buddy ðŸ“–

Our group aims to empower students to manage their academic progress and their peersâ€™ through an mobile application, StudyBuddy. 

StudyBuddy provides an interactive platform where students can add tasks into a personalized schedule, monitor their progress, and support each other through collaborative study sessions. 


This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```
   npx expo install expo-linear-gradient

   ```
   npm install react-native-maps expo-location

   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
